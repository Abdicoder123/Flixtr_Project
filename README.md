Reflection
Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
Yes i think they generally did, I feel like we did not go super in depth on CSS styling, but it could be the case
that I was not present during that. That was the part that was last on the things I needed to do and was the most troubling because of how I set up my display function.

If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
I thinked I would a whole lot more CSS styling and perhaps simplified by display function since I believe it is a 
little too weird.

Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
I noticed my peers had way better CSS styling and that is something I do want to put an emphasis on next time around.
